#Develop a single-page application in React and Typescript which shows a customer details portal with the following specifications:
1. The portal has a list of customers on the left side and upon clicking a card on the left
the details of the customer are shown on the right side.
2. The customer list on the left can contain as many as 1000 entries.
3. The card in the list shows the name of the customer and his title.
4. Customer details include the customer name, title, address, and a 3x3 grid of 9
photos.
5. The selected card on the left is highlighted.
6. All the pictures in the photo grid should change every 10 seconds. Fetch the photos
from any public API.
Sample Design:

All the layout and state management should be implemented using React, HTML, CSS and
Typescript best practices. The component re-rendering and hooks should also follow all best
practices and optimisations.
Push the project and run instructions to GitHub and email us the public repository link.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
